<h1>CRY FROM A<br />
FAR PLANET</h1>

<p class="tease"><i>The problem of separating the
friends from the enemies was
a major one in the conquest of
space as many a dead spacer
could have testified. A tough
job when you could see an
alien and judge appearances;
far tougher when they were
only whispers on the wind.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>A smile of friendship is a baring
of the teeth. So is a snarl of
menace. It can be fatal to mistake

UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.</i></p>

<p class="rgt">&mdash;From <i>Exploration Ship's Handbook</i>.</p></div>



<p class="cap"><span class="dcap">He listened</span> in the silence
of the Exploration ship's
control room. He heard nothing
but that was what bothered
him; an ominous quiet when
there should have been a multitude
of sounds from the nearby
village for the viewscreen's audio-pickups
to transmit. And it
was more than six hours past
the time when the native,
Throon, should have come to sit
with him outside the ship as
they resumed the laborious attempt
to learn each other's language.</p>





<p>The viewscreen was black in
the light of the control room,
even though it was high noon
outside. The dull red sun was
always invisible through the
world's thick atmosphere and to
human eyes full day was no
more than a red-tinged darkness.</p>

<p>He switched on the ship's
outside floodlights and the viewscreen
came to bright white life,
showing the empty glades reaching
away between groves of
purple alien trees. He noticed,
absently, that the trees seemed
to have changed a little in color
since his arrival.</p>

<p>The village was hidden from
view by the outer trees but
there should have been some activity
in the broad area visible
to him. There was none, not
even along the distant segment
of what should have been a busy
road. The natives were up to
something and he knew, from
hard experience on other alien
worlds, that it would be nothing
good. It would be another misunderstanding
of some kind and
he didn't know enough of their
incomprehensible language to
ask them what it was&mdash;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Suddenly, as it always came,
he felt someone or something
standing close behind him and
peering over his shoulder. He
dropped his hand to the blaster
he had taken to wearing at all
times and whirled.</p>

<p>Nothing was behind him.
There never was. The control
room was empty, with no hiding
place for anything, and the door
was closed, locked by the remote-control
button beside him. There
was nothing.</p>

<p>The sensation of being watched
faded, as though the watcher
had withdrawn to a greater distance.
It was perhaps the hundredth
time within six days that
he had felt the sensation. And
when he slept at night something
came to nuzzle at his
mind; faceless, formless, utterly
alien. For the past three nights
he had not let the blaster get
beyond quick reach of his hand,
even when in bed.</p>

<p>But whatever it was, it could
not be on the ship. He had
searched the ship twice, a methodical
compartment-by-compartment
search that had found
nothing. It had to be the work
of the natives from outside the
ship. Except....</p>

<p>Why, if the natives were
telepathic, did the one called
Throon go through the weary
pretense of trying to learn a mutually
understandable form of
communication?</p>

<p>There was one other explanation,
which he could not accept:
that he was following in the
footsteps of Will Garret of Ship
Nine who had deliberately gone
into a white sun two months
after the death of his twin
brother.</p>

<p>He looked at the chair beside
his own, Johnny's chair, which
would forever be empty, and his
thoughts went back down the
old, bitter paths. The Exploration
Board had been wrong when
they thought the close bond between
identical twins would
make them the ideal two-man
crews for the lonely, lifetime
journeys of the Exploration
Ships. Identical twins were too
close; when one of them died,
the other died in part with him.</p>

<p>They had crossed a thousand
light-years of space together, he
and Johnny, when they came to
the bleak planet that he would
name Johnny's World. He should
never have let Johnny go alone
up the slope of the honey-combed
mountain&mdash;but Johnny had
wanted to take the routine record
photographs of the black,
tiger-like beasts which they had
called cave cats and the things
had seemed harmless and shy,
despite their ferocious appearance.</p>

<p>"I'm taking them a sack of
food that I think they might
like," Johnny had said. "I want
to try to get some good close-up
shots of them."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later he heard
the distant snarl of Johnny's
blaster. He ran up the mountainside,
knowing already that he
was too late. He found two of
the cave cats lying where Johnny
had killed them. Then he
found Johnny, at the foot of a
high cliff. He was dead, his neck
broken by the fall. Scattered all
around him from the torn sack
was the food he had wanted to
give to the cats.</p>

<p>He buried Johnny the next
day, while a cold wind moaned
under a lead-gray sky. He built
a monument for him; a little
mound of frosty stones that only
the wild animals would ever
see&mdash;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A chime rang, high and clear,
and the memories were shattered.
The orange light above the
hyperspace communicator was
flashing; the signal that meant
the Exploration Board was calling
him from Earth.</p>

<p>He flipped the switch and said,
"Paul Jameson, Exploration
Ship One."</p>

<p>The familiar voice of Brender
spoke:</p>

<p>"It's been some time since
your preliminary report. Is
everything all right?"</p>

<p>"In a way," he answered. "I
was going to give you the detailed
report tomorrow."</p>

<p>"Give me a brief sketch of it
now."</p>

<p>"Except for their short brown
fur, the natives are humanoid in
appearance. But there are basic
differences. Their body temperature
is cool, like their climate.
Their vision range is from just
within the visible red on into the
infrared. They'll shade their
eyes from the light of anything
as hot as boiling water but
they'll look square into the
ship's floodlights and never see
them."</p>

<p>"And their knowledge of science?"
Brender asked.</p>

<p>"They have a good understanding
of it, but along lines
entirely different from what our
own were at their stage of development.
For example: they
power their machines with
chemicals but there is no steam,
heat, or exhaust."</p>

<p>"That's what we want to find&mdash;worlds
where branches of research
unknown to our science
are being explored. How about
their language?"</p>

<p>"No progress with it yet." He
told Brender of the silence in
the village and added, "Even if
Throon should show up I could
not ask him what was wrong.
I've learned a few words but
they have so many different
definitions that I can't use
them."</p>

<p>"I know," Brender said. "Variable
and unrelated definitions,
undetectable shades of inflection&mdash;and
sometimes a language that
has no discernibly separate
words. The Singer brothers of
Ship Eight ran into the latter.
We've given them up as lost."</p>

<p>"The Singers&mdash;dead?" he exclaimed.
"Good God&mdash;it's been
only a month since the Ramon
brothers were killed."</p>

<p>"The circumstances were
similar," Brender said. "They
always are. There is no way the
Exploration men can tell the
natives that they mean them no
harm and the suspicion of the
natives grows into dangerous
hostility. The Singers reported
the natives on that world to be
both suspicious and possessing
powerful weapons. The Singers
were proceeding warily, their
own weapons always at hand.
But, somehow, the natives
caught them off-guard&mdash;their
last report was four months
ago."</p>

<p>There was a silence, then
Brender added, "Their ship was
the ninth&mdash;and we had only fifteen."</p>

<p>He did not reply to the implications
of Brender's statement.
It was obvious to them all what
the end of the Plan would be.
What it had to be.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It had been only three years
since the fifteen heavily armed
Exploration ships set out to
lead the way for Terran expansion
across the galaxy; to answer
a cry from far planets, and
to find all the worlds that held
intelligent life. That was the
ultimate goal of the Plan: to
accumulate and correlate all the
diverse knowledge of all the intelligent
life-forms in the galaxy.
Among the achievements
resulting from that tremendous
mass of data would be a ship's
drive faster even than hyperspace;
the Third Level Drive
which would bring all the galaxies
of the universe within
reach.</p>

<p>And now nine ships were gone
out of fifteen and nineteen men
out of thirty....</p>

<p>"The communication barrier,"
Brender said. "The damned
communication barrier has been
the cause behind the loss of
every ship. And there is nothing
we can do about it. We're
stymied by it...."</p>

<p>The conversation was terminated
shortly afterward and he
moved about the room restlessly,
wishing it was time to lift ship
again. With Johnny not there
the dark world was like a
smothering tomb. He would like
to leave it behind and drive
again into the star clouds of the
galaxy; drive on and on into
them&mdash;</p>

<p>A ghostly echo touched his
mind; restless, poignantly yearning.
He swung to face the locked
door, knowing there could be
nothing behind it. The first real
fear came to him as he did so.
The thing was lonely&mdash;the thing
that watched him was as lonely
as he was....</p>

<p>What else could any of it be
but the product of a mind in the
first stage of insanity?</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The natives came ten minutes
later.</p>

<p>The viewscreen showed their
chemically-powered vehicle
emerge from the trees and roll
swiftly across the glade. Four
natives were in it while a fifth
one lay on the floor, apparently
badly injured.</p>

<p>The vehicle stopped a short
distance in front of the airlock
and he recognized the native on
the floor. It was Throon, the one
with whom he had been exchanging
language lessons.</p>

<p>They were waiting for him
when he emerged from the ship,
pistol-like weapons in their belts
and grim accusation in their
manner.</p>

<p>Throon was muttering unintelligibly,
unconscious. His skin,
where not covered by the brown
fur, was abnormal in appearance.
He was dying.</p>

<p>The leader of the four indicated
Throon and said in a quick,
brittle voice: "<i>Ko reegar feen
no-dran!</i>"</p>

<p>Only one word was familiar:
<i>Ko</i>, which meant "you" and
"yesterday" and a great many
other things. The question was
utterly meaningless to him.</p>

<p>He dropped his hand a little
nearer his blaster as the leader
spoke again; a quick succession
of unknown words that ended
with a harshly demanding "<i>kreson!</i>"</p>

<p><i>Kreson</i> meant "now," or "very
quickly." All the other words
were unfamiliar to him. They
waited, the grim menace about
them increasing when he did not
answer. He tried in vain to find
some way of explaining to them
he was not responsible for
Throon's sickness and could not
cure it.</p>

<p>Then he saw the spray of
leaves that had caught on the
corner of the vehicle when it
came through the farther trees.</p>

<p>They were of a deep purple
color. All the trees around the
ship were almost gray by contrast.</p>

<p>Which meant that he <i>was</i> responsible
for Throon's condition.</p>

<p>The cold white light of the
ship's floodlights, under which
he and Throon had sat for day
after day, contained radiations
that went through the violet and
far into the ultraviolet. To the
animal and vegetable life of the
dark world such radiations were
invisibly short and deadly.</p>

<p>Throon was dying of hard-radiation
sickness.</p>

<p>It was something he should
have foreseen and avoided&mdash;and
that would not have happened
had he accepted old Throon's
pantomimed invitation, in the
beginning, to go with him into
the village to work at the language
study. There he would
have used a harmless battery
lamp for illumination ... but
there was no certainty that the
natives were not planning to lay
a trap for him in the village and
he had refused to go.</p>

<p>It did not matter&mdash;there was
a complex radiation-neutralizer
and cell-reconstructor in the ship
which would return Throon to
full, normal health a few hours
after he was placed in its chamber.</p>

<p>He turned to the leader of the
four natives and motioned from
Throon to the airlock. "Go&mdash;there,"
he said in the native language.</p>

<p>"<i>Bron!</i>" the leader answered.
The word meant "No" and there
was a determination in the way
he said it that showed he would
not move from it.</p>

<p>At the end of five minutes his
attempts to persuade them to
take Throon into the ship had
increased their suspicion of his
motives to the point of critical
danger. If only he could tell them
<i>why</i> he wanted Throon taken
into the ship ... But he could
not and would have to take
Throon by first disposing of the
four without injuring them.
This he could do by procuring
one of the paralyzing needle-guns
from the ship.</p>

<p>He took a step toward the ship
and spoke the words that to the
best of his knowledge meant: "I
come back."</p>

<p>"<i>Feswin ilt k'la.</i>"</p>

<p>Their reply was to snatch at
their weapons in desperate
haste, even as the leader uttered
a hoarse word of command. He
brought up the blaster with the
quick motion that long training
had perfected and their weapons
were only half drawn when
his warning came:</p>

<p>"<i>Bron!</i>"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>They froze, but did not release
their weapons. He walked
backward to the airlock, his
blaster covering them, the tensely
waiting manner in which
they watched his progress telling
him that the slightest relaxation
of his vigilance would mean his
death. He did not let the muzzle
of the blaster waver until he was
inside the airlock and the outer
door had slid shut.</p>

<p>He was sure that the natives
would be gone when he returned.
And he was sure of another
thing: That whatever he had
said to them, it was not what he
had thought he was saying.</p>

<p>He saw that the glade was
empty when he opened the airlock
again. At the same time a
bomb-like missile struck the
ship just above the airlock and
exploded with a savage crash.
He jabbed the <i>Close</i> button and
the door clicked shut barely in
advance of three more missiles
which hammered at its impervious
armor.</p>

<p>So that, he thought wearily,
is that.</p>

<p>He laid the useless needle-gun
aside. The stage was past when
he could hope to use it. He could
save Throon only by killing some
of the others&mdash;or he could lift
ship and leave Throon to die.
Either action would make the
natives hate and fear Terrans;
a hatred and fear that would be
there to greet all future Terran
ships.</p>

<p>That was not the way a race
gave birth to peaceful galactic
empire, was not the purpose behind
the Plan. But always,
wherever the Exploration men
went, they encountered the deadly
barrier; the intangible, unassailable
communication barrier.
With the weapons an Exploration
man carried in his
ship he had the power to destroy
a world&mdash;but not the power to
ask the simple questions that
would prevent fatal misunderstandings.</p>

<p>And before another three
years had passed the last Exploration
man would die, the last
Exploration ship would be lost.</p>

<p>He felt the full force of hopelessness
for the first time. When
Johnny had been alive it had
been different; Johnny, who had
laughed whenever the outlook
was the darkest and said, "<i>We'll
find a way, Paul&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>The thought broke as suddenly,
unexpectedly, he felt that
Johnny was very near. With the
feeling came the soft enclosure
of a dream-like peace in which
Johnny's death was vague and
faraway; only something that
had happened in another dream.
He knew, without wondering
why, that Johnny was in the control
room.</p>

<p>A part of his mind tried to
reject the thought as an illusion.
He did not listen&mdash;he did not
want to listen. He ran to the
ship's elevator, stumbling like
one not fully awake. Johnny was
waiting for him in the control
room&mdash;alive&mdash;alive&mdash;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He spoke as he stepped into
the control room:</p>

<p>"Johnny&mdash;"</p>

<p>Something moved at the control
board, black and alien,
standing tall as a man on short
hind legs. Yellow eyes blazed in
a feline face.</p>

<p>It was a cave cat, like the
ones that had killed Johnny.</p>

<p>Realization was a wrenching
shock and a terrible disillusionment.
Johnny was not waiting
for him&mdash;not alive&mdash;</p>

<p>He brought up the blaster, the
dream-like state gone. The paw
of the cave cat flashed out and
struck the ship's master light
switch with a movement faster
than his own. The room was instantly,
totally, dark.</p>

<p>He fired and pale blue fire
lanced across the room, to reveal
that the cave cat was gone.
He fired again, quickly and immediately
in front of him. The
pale beam revealed only the
ripped metal floor.</p>

<p>"<i>I am not where you think.</i>"</p>

<p>The words spoke clearly in his
mind but there was no directional
source. He held his breath, listening
for the whisper of padded
feet as the cave cat flashed in
for the kill, and made a swift
analysis of the situation.</p>

<p>The cave cat was telepathic
and highly intelligent and had
been on the ship all the time. It
and the others had wanted the
ship and had killed Johnny to
reduce opposition to the minimum.
He, himself, had been permitted
to live until the cave cat
learned from his mind how to
operate the almost-automatic
controls. Now, he had served his
purpose&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>You are wrong.</i>"</p>

<p>Again there was no way he
could determine the direction
from which the thought came.
He listened again, and wondered
why it had not waylaid him at
the door.</p>

<p>Its thought came:</p>

<p>"<i>I had to let you see me or
you would not have believed I
existed. It was only here that I
could extinguish all lights and
have time to speak before you
killed me. I let you think your
brother was here....</i>" There was
a little pause. "<i>I am sorry. I
am sorry. I should have used
some other method of luring you
here.</i>"</p>

<p>He swung the blaster toward
what seemed to be a faint sound
near the astrogator unit across
the room.</p>

<p>"<i>We did not intend to kill
your brother.</i>"</p>

<p>He did not believe it and did
not reply.</p>

<p>"<i>When we made first telepathic
contact with him, he
jerked up his blaster and fired.
In his mind was the conviction
that we had pretended to be
harmless animals so that we
could catch him off-guard and
kill him. One of us leaped at him
as he fired the second time, to
knock the blaster from his hand.
We needed only a few minutes
in which to explain&mdash;but he
would not trust us that long.
There was a misjudgment of
distance and he was knocked off
the cliff.</i>"</p>

<p>Again he did not reply.</p>

<p>"<i>We did not intend to kill your
brother</i>," the thought came,
"<i>but you do not believe me</i>."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He spoke for the first time.
"No, I don't believe you. You are
physically like cats and cats
don't misjudge distances. Now,
you want something from me before
you try to kill me, too. What
is it?"</p>

<p>"<i>I will have to tell you of my
race for you to understand. We
call ourselves the Varn, in so far
as it can be translated into a
spoken word, and we are a very
old race. In the beginning we did
not live in caves but there came
a long period of time, for thousands
of years, when the climate
on our world was so violent that
we were forced to live in the
caves. It was completely dark
there but our sense of smell became
very acute, together with
sufficient sensitivity to temperature
changes that we could detect
objects in our immediate vicinity.
There were subterranean
plants in the caves and food was
no problem.</i>"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"<i>We had always been slightly
telepathic and it was during our
long stay in the caves that our
intelligence and telepathic powers
became fully developed. We
had only our minds&mdash;physical
science is not created in dark
caves with clumsy paws.</i></p>

<p>"<i>The time finally came when
we could leave the caves but it
was of little help to us. There
were no resources on our world
but earth and stone and the thin
grass of the plains. We wondered
about the universe and we
knew the stars were distant
suns because one of our own suns
became a star each winter. We
studied as best we could but we
could see the stars only as the
little wild animals saw them.
There was so much we wanted
to learn and by then we were
past our zenith and already dying
out. But our environment
was a prison from which we
could never escape.</i></p>

<p>"<i>When your ship arrived we
thought we might soon be free.
We wanted to ask you to take
some of us with you and arrange
for others of your race to stop
by on our world. But you dismissed
us as animals, useful
only for making warm fur
coats, because we lived in caves
and had no science, no artifacts&mdash;nothing.
You had the power to
destroy us and we did not know
what your reaction would be
when you learned we were intelligent
and telepathic. A telepathic
race must have a high
code of ethics and never intrude
unwanted&mdash;but would you have
believed that?</i>"</p>

<p>He did not answer.</p>

<p>"<i>The death of your brother
changed everything. You were
going to leave so soon that there
would be no time to learn more
about you. I hid on the ship so
I could study you and wait until
I could prove to you that you
needed me. Now, I can&mdash;Throon
is dying and I can give you the
proper words of explanation that
will cause the others to bring
him into the ship.</i>"</p>

<p>"Your real purpose&mdash;what is
it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"<i>To show you that men need
the Varn. You want to explore
the galaxy, and learn. So do the
Varn. You have the ships and
we have the telepathic ability
that will end the communication
problem. Your race and mine
can succeed only if we go together.</i>"</p>

<p>He searched for the true, and
hidden, purpose behind the Varn
proposal and saw what it would
have to be.</p>

<p>"The long-range goal&mdash;you
failed to mention that ... your
ultimate aim."</p>

<p>"<i>I know what you are thinking.
How can I prove you wrong&mdash;now?</i>"</p>

<p>There was no way for the
Varn to prove him wrong, nor
for him to prove the treachery
behind the Varn proposal. The
proof would come only with
time, when the Terran-Varn co-operation
had transformed Terrans
into a slave race.</p>

<p>The Varn spoke again. "<i>You
refuse to believe I am sincere?</i>"</p>

<p>"I would be a naive fool to
believe you."</p>

<p>"<i>It will be too late to save
Throon unless we act very quickly.
I have told you why I am
here. There is nothing more I
can do to convince you but be
the first to show trust. When I
switch on the lights it will be
within your power to kill me.</i>"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Varn was gambling its
life in a game in which he would
be gambling the Plan and his
race. It was a game he would
end at the first sound of movement
from the astrogator unit
across the room....</p>

<p>"<i>I have been here beside you
all the time.</i>"</p>

<p>A furry paw brushed his face,
claws flicked gently but grimly
reminding along his throat.</p>

<p>He whirled and fired. He was
too late&mdash;the Varn had already
leaped silently away and the
beam found only the bare floor.
Then the lights came on, glaringly
bright after the darkness,
and he saw the Varn.</p>

<p>It was standing by the control
board, its huge yellow eyes
watching him. He brought the
blaster into line with it, his finger
on the firing stud. It waited,
not moving or shrinking from
what was coming. The translucent
golden eyes looked at him
and beyond him, as though they
saw something not in the room.
He wondered if it was in contact
with its own kind on
Johnny's World and was telling
them it had made the gamble for
high stakes, and had lost.</p>

<p>It was not afraid&mdash;not asking
for mercy....</p>

<p>The killing of it was suddenly
an act without savor. It was
something he would do in the
immediate future but first he
would let it live long enough to
save Throon.</p>

<p>He motioned with the blaster
and said, "Lead the way to the
airlock."</p>

<p>"<i>And afterward&mdash;you will kill
me?</i>"</p>

<p>"Lead the way," he repeated
harshly.</p>

<p>It said no more but went
obediently past him and trotted
down the corridor like a great,
black dog.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>He stood in the open airlock,
the Varn against the farther
wall where he had ordered it to
stand. Throon was in the radiation
chamber and he had held
his first intelligible conversation
with the natives that day.</p>

<p>The Varn was facing into the
red-black gloom outside the
lighted airlock, where the departing
natives could be heard
crossing the glade. "<i>Their
thoughts no longer hold fear
and suspicion</i>," it said. "<i>The misunderstanding
is ended.</i>"</p>

<p>He raised the muzzle of the
blaster in his hand. The black
head lifted and the golden eyes
looked up at him.</p>

<p>"I made you no promise," he
said.</p>

<p>"<i>I could demand none.</i>"</p>

<p>"I can't stop to take you back
to your own world and I can't
leave you alive on this one&mdash;with
what you've learned from
my mind you would have the natives
build the Varn a disintegrator-equipped
space fleet equal
to our own ships."</p>

<p>"<i>We want only to go with
you.</i>"</p>

<p>He told it what he wanted it
to know before he killed it, wondering
why he should care:</p>

<p>"I would like to believe you
are sincere&mdash;and you know why
I don't dare to. Trusting a telepathic
race would be too dangerous.
The Varn would know
everything we knew and only the
Varn would be able to communicate
with each new alien race.
We would have to believe what
the Varn told us&mdash;we would
have to trust the Varn to see for
us and speak for us and not deceive
us as we went across the
galaxy. And then, in the end,
Terrans would no longer be
needed except as a subject race.
They would be enslaved.</p>

<p>"We would have laid the
groundwork for an empire&mdash;the
Varn Empire."</p>

<p>There was a silence, in which
his words hung like something
cold and invisible between them.</p>

<p>Then the Varn asked, very
quietly:</p>

<p>"<i>Why is the Plan failing?</i>"</p>

<p>"You already know," he said.
"Because of the barrier&mdash;the
communication barrier that
causes aliens to misunderstand
the intentions of Exploration
men and fear them."</p>

<p>"<i>There is no communication
barrier between you and I&mdash;yet
you fear me and are going to
kill me.</i>"</p>

<p>"I have to kill you. You represent
a danger to my race."</p>

<p>"<i>Isn't that the same reason
why aliens kill Exploration men?</i>"</p>

<p>He did not answer and its
thought came, quickly, "<i>How
does an Exploration man appear
to the natives of alien worlds?</i>"</p>

<p>How did he appear?... He
landed on their world in a ship
that could smash it into oblivion;
he stepped out of his ship
carrying weapons that could
level a city; he represented
irresistible power for destruction
and he trusted no one and
nothing.</p>

<p>And in return he hoped to find
welcome and friendship and co-operation....</p>

<p>"<i>There</i>," the Varn said, "<i>is
your true barrier&mdash;your own distrust
and suspicion. You, yourselves,
create it on each new
world. Now you are going to
erect it between my race and
yours by killing me and advising
the Exploration Board to
quarantine my world and never
let another ship land there.</i>"</p>

<p>Again there was a silence as
he thought of what the Varn
had said and of what it had said
earlier: "<i>We are a very old race....</i>"
There was wisdom in the
Varn's analysis of the cause of
the Plan's failure and with the
Varn to vanquish the communication
stalemate, the new approach
could be tried. They
could go a long way together,
men and Varn, a long, long
way....</p>

<p>Or they could create the Varn
Empire ... and how could he
know which it would be?</p>

<p>How could anyone know&mdash;except
the telepathic Varn?</p>

<p>The muzzle of the blaster had
dropped and he brought it back
up. He forced the dangerous indecision
aside, knowing he would
have to kill the Varn at once or
he might weaken again, and said
harshly to it:</p>

<p>"The risk is too great. I want
to believe you&mdash;but all your talk
of trust and good intentions is
only talk and my race would be
the only one that had to trust."</p>

<p>He touched the firing stud as
the last thought of the Varn
came:</p>

<p>"<i>Let me speak once more.</i>"</p>

<p>He waited, the firing stud cold
and metallic under his finger.</p>

<p>"<i>You are wrong. We have already
set the example of faith
in you by asking to go with you.
I told you we did not intend to
hurt your brother and I told you
we saw the stars only as the
little wild animals saw them.
The years in the dark caves&mdash;you
do not understand&mdash;</i>"</p>

<p>The eyes of the Varn looked
into his and beyond him; beautiful,
expressionless, like polished
gold.</p>

<p>"<i>The Varn are blind.</i>"</p>


<p class="theend">THE END</p>
